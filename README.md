# JWipe_Disk-Sanitization
This project features a PowerShell script that guides users through securely wiping any connected drives. Users can select the target disk and customize the number of passes for data erasure. The script automatically configures and runs a diskpart script to perform the sanitization, ensuring data is thoroughly and securely erased.
